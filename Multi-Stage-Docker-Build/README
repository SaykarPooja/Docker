Distroless Images:

A distroless image is a type of Docker image that contains only your application and its runtime dependencies, without including a full operating system or shell utilities.
The idea is to make images smaller, more secure, and easier to manage.

Multistage Build:

A multistage build in Docker is a technique where you use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile to build your application in stages. 
This helps you create smaller, cleaner, and production-ready images.


You can use any name for your Dockerfile, not just the default Dockerfile. 
But when you do, you must explicitly tell Docker the file name with the -f flag in the docker build command.

Here's how to correct your command and explanation:


docker build -t btspooja/docker7:7 -f /home/ubuntu/Docker/Multi-Stage-Docker-Build/dockerfile-for-multistage /home/ubuntu/Docker/Multi-Stage-Docker-Build/

         Part	                                Meaning
       docker build                           ------>	Build a Docker image
      -t btspooja/docker7:7	                  ------>Name and tag of the image
-f /home/.../dockerfile-for-multistage        ------>	Use this Dockerfile instead of default Dockerfile
/home/.../Multi-Stage-Docker-Build/	          ------>Build context: folder with your project files
